In this project I will use the skills that I have learned during the HTML foundations course to build a basic recipe site.

I intend to use HTML elements I have learned to utilize features such as:
paragraphs
lists (ordered and unordered)
bold words
emphasize (italicize)
create links (absolute and relative)
images
